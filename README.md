``What I have learned about Git/Github``
So far what I have learned about Git/Github is mainly related to creating and managing remote versions of my projects.  I know a lot more about how to setup a project from my local machine and how to push changes up to the server than I do about cloning a project from Github and then working on it locally.  But so far I have learned how to setup remote repositories, how to push to them, how to pull from them, how to amend a comment from a previous push, things like that.  I would say that the most difficult thing that I have learned is how to properly merge changes together when you're version is behind what is on the server and you are attempting to push to the server.  Reading the error that the terminal gave me wasn't overly helpful.  All it did was tell me what the issue was and not exactly how to fix it.  I figured out that I had to just act like the changes that I had made were its own new commit which meant that I also had to add the files to the staging area first and then I could push my changes up to the server.
